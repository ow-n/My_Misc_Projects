# =========================={ Notes }========================== #
# No syscalls to not skew the results from using data caches.
# Use LRU rather than random replacement so results are consistant.

# ========================{ Questions }======================== #
# Set up the data cache parameters of the Data Cache Simulator such that:
# 
# 1.The two arrays map directly on top of one another.
#   With a block size of one (1) and Direct Mapped, run the simulator.
#   What is the hit rate? - 0%
#
# 2.Still Direct Mapped, what is the hit rate with a block size of two (2)? - 50%
#   (Remember, since we are testing cache performance, the cache size must always remain the same!
#   Make whatever adjustments are necessary so that the cache size always remains the same,
#   otherwise you are comparing apples and oranges.)
#
# 3.As in 2 directly above, but with a block size of four (4), what is the hit rate? - 75%
# 
# 4.Configure the cache as 2-way set associative with a block size
#   of one and iterate twice through the data loading sequence
#   (put a loop around the original sequence). What is the hit rate? - 50%
# 
# 5.Configure the cache as 4-way set associative with a block size
#   of one and iterate twice through the data loading sequence.
#   What is the hit rate? - 50%
#
# 6.As in 5 above, but fully associative. What is the hit rate? - 50%
#
# 7.If you run the program again without resetting the
#   cache simulator what is the hit rate? - 0%
# 
# 8.If you repeat 7 above 100 times what will be the
#   hit rate rounded to the 1â€™s place. - 100%
